    "There are 3 types of Cursors in java:\n",
    "1. Enumeration\n",
    "2. Iterator\n",
    "3. ListIterator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enumeration\n",
    "We can use enumeration to get objects one by one, only for legacy collection object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create enumeration object using elements() of vector class\n",
    "~~~java\n",
    "public Enumeration elements();\n",
    "\n",
    "Enumeration e = v.elements();\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",

    "#### Methods:\n",
    "~~~java\n",
    "public boolean hasMoreElements();\n",
    "public Object nextElement();\n",

    "while (e.hasMoreElements()){\n",
    "    Interger I = (Interger) e.nextElement();\n",
    "}\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enumeration only for legacy classes and it is not a universal cursor\n",
    "2. By using Enumeration we can get only read access and we can't perform remove operation.\n",
    "3. To overcome above limitations we should go for Iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterator(I)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can apply Iterator for any collection object and hence it is universal cursor.\n",
    "2. By using Iterator we can perform, both read and remove operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create Iterator obj by using iterator method of collection interface.\n",
    "~~~java\n",

    "public boolean hasNext();\n",
    "public Object next();\n",
    "public void remove();\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By using Enumeration and Iterator we can always move only towards forward direction and can't move towards backward direction. These are single direction cursors.\n",
    "2. By uing Iterator we can perform read, remove operations and we can't perform replacement and addition of new objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To over come above limitations we should go for ListIterator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ListIterator\n",
    "1. By using ListIterator we can move either forward direction or backwards direction and hence it is bidirectional cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using ListIterator we can perform, replacement and addition of new objects in addition to read and remove operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create ListIterator by using listIterator method of ListIterator (I)\n",
    "~~~java\n",
    "public ListIterator listIterator();\n",
    "\n",
    "ListIterator ltr = l.listIterator();\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
