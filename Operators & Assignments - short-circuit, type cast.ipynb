    "##### &, | - \n",
    "1. Both args should be evaluated always\n",
    "2. Performance is low\n",
    "3. Applicable for both boolean and for intgreal types\n",
    "##### &&, || - \n",
    "1. Second args evaluation is optional\n",
    "2. Performance is high\n",
    "3. Applicable for only boolean but not intgreal types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. x&y = y will be evaluated iff x is true\n",

    "    * It is also known as narrowing or downcasting\n",
